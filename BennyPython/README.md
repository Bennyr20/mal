First Log entry! Woohoo!

Forked and cloned git repository. Ready to start work on writing the LISP interpreter at step 0: REPL (read, evaluate, print).

Finished step0
along with the optional command history part.

Start work on step1

step1 symbols work. Lists do not work at the moment.

it is 3pm and Lists now work! I spent over an hour on really stupid bugs, but that's programming for yah!
